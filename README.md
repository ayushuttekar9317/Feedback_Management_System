College Feedback Management System

This project is a College Feedback Management System that helps collect student feedback in an online and digital way. Instead of using paper forms, students can submit their feedback through a website. The feedback is saved securely in a database and can be viewed or exported for further analysis.

The system has a simple feedback form where students enter their details and give feedback about subjects and teaching. When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the backend and stored in a MySQL database. This makes feedback management easy, organized, and error-free.

The project is useful for colleges and educational institutions to understand student opinions and improve teaching quality. It also reduces manual work and keeps all feedback records in one place.
